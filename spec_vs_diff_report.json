  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive Wingo game platform covering backend logic, frontend UI, and neon theming. All three major requirements appear substantially implemented. The backend includes round management, bet storage, payout logic, and query/update endpoints. The frontend covers the lobby, countdown timer, round history, betting panel, result modal, and bet history table. Neon theming is applied throughout. Minor gaps exist around the backend's round resolution trigger and whether rounds are persisted with winning numbers after resolution.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Expose an update function to trigger round resolution that persists winning number and color result",
      "reason": "The getCurrentRound function in the visible backend code returns winningNumber=null and colorResult=null always, constructing the round on-the-fly from Time.now() without persisting resolved results. An explicit resolveRound update function that stores winners and computes payouts is not clearly present in the truncated diff.",
